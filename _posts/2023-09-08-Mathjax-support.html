<p>
    Mathjax is a javascript engine for displaying \(\LaTeX\) commands on webpages. An inline equation should be put inside a pair of \ <q>backslash</q> and ( <q> bracket</q>. For example, <code> \(f(x)\) </code>  produces \(f(x)\). Math equations that go on a single line should be place indside  \ <q>backslash</q> and [ <q> square bracket</q> pair. For example, <code>\[ f(x) - x < 0 \]</code> produces the following.
    \[ f(x) - x < 0 \]

    I am planning to add some sort of .sty file for this website. If the need arise, which certainly does, I will implement some extension for Mathjax.
